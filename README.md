This is a multi-part repository it contains code for:

- The *freva-rest service* defining rest endpoints
  that make up the freva server services
- The *freva-client* library that provide command line interfaces and python
  libraries for their rest service counterparts.
- The *freva-data-loader-portal* that implements rules of how to open different
  data sources and stream them via zarr.

## Installation for development

1. Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2. Clone this repository:

```console
git clone --recursive git@github.com:FREVA-CLINT/freva-nextgen.git
cd freva-nextgen
```

3. Install all components:

```console
python -m pip install -e ./freva-rest[dev] -e ./freva-client -e ./freva-data-portal-worker[full]
```

4. Generate a new pair of self signed certificates

```console
python run_server.py --gen-certs
```

### Development Environment
Various services, such as apache solr are needed to run the rest services system
in a development environment. Here we set up these services in a containers
using the `docker-compose` or `podman-compose` command, ensure
you have `docker-compose` or `podman-compose` installed on your system.
Then, run the following command:

```console
docker-compose -f dev-env/docker-compose.yaml up -d --remove-orphans
```

if you use `podman-compose`:

```console
podman-compose -f dev-env/docker-compose.yaml up -d --remove-orphans
```

This will start the required services and containers to create the development
environment. You can now develop and test the project within this environment.

After the containers are up and running you can start the REST server the following:

```console
python run_server.py -c api_config.toml --debug --dev -p 7777 -f
```

The ``--debug`` and ``--dev`` flag will make sure that any changes are loaded.
You can choose any port you like. Furthermore the ``--dev`` flag will pre
load any existing test data. If you don't like that simply do not pass the
``--dev`` flag.


### Test ldap instance
The dev system sets up a small LDAP server for testing. The following users
in this ldap server are available:

- uid: ``johndoe``, password: ``johndoe123``
- uid: ``janedoe``, password: ``janedoe123``
- uid: ``alicebrown``, password: ``alicebrown123``
- uid: ``bobsmith``, password: ``bobsmith123``
- uid: ``lisajones``, password: ``lisajones123``

## Testing

Unit tests, Example notebook tests, type annotations and code style tests
are done with [tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/). To run all tests, linting
in parallel simply execute the following command:

```console
tox -p 3
```
You can also run the each part alone, for example to only check the code style:

```console
tox -e lint
```
available options are ``lint``, ``types``, ``test``.

Tox runs in a separate python environment to run the tests in the current
environment use:


```console
python -m pip install -e freva-rest[tests] freva-client freva-data-portal-worker
pytest -vv ./tests
```
### Creating a new release.

Once the development is finished and you decide that it's time for a new
release of the software use the following command to trigger a release
procedure:

```console
tox -e release
```

This will check the current version of the `main` branch and trigger
a GitHub continuous integration pipeline to create a new release. The procedure
performs a couple of checks, if theses checks fail please make sure to address
the issues.
